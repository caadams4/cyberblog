# UTCTF

## Summary
An overall good set of challenges; I tried my hand at four but only solved two. I had much success at the network security problems. Even though I didn't finish the forensics, I learned alot. So that's good, I guess.

## CTF Solves 
The second solve is dependent to the first, so I will combine them into one writeup.
