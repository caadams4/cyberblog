# UTCTF 2023

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Summary
A great set of challenges. I didn't have much time this weekend, so I tried my hand at one reverse engineer problem and successfully solved the problem.

## 1. Homework Help

* PICTURE HERE

The challenge includes one binary file. Lets download it and open it up with Ghidra. 

* If you're not familiar with Ghidra, it's a sick NSA tool used to decompile binaries

Now that we have a picture of what the is happening within the file, lets run it through the radare2 (r2) debugger, and watch it in execution.

Lets start the binary using r2 and set a breakpoint at the flag xor loop in __stack_chk_fail.

Ok, when it asks for input, we're going to send 'wctf{}'. Why? Well this is WolvCTF and flag format begins with 'wctf{', thus we can safely assume the decryptor will successfully process the first 5 characters and fail on the 6th.
